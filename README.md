# Wildlife-Sound-Analyzer# Wildlife Sound Analyzer ðŸ¦‰

A **Streamlit-based Python application** to record or upload wildlife sounds and analyze them.  
The system identifies species, classifies their behavior, and provides ecosystem insights.

---

## **Features**

1. **Record or Upload Wildlife Sounds**  
   - Upload audio files in WAV, MP3, or FLAC format.  

2. **Species Identification**  
   - Detects the species from audio (currently uses a dummy classifier for demonstration; can be replaced with ML models).  

3. **Behavior Analysis**  
   - Infers likely behavior of the detected species (e.g., chirping, howling, croaking).  

4. **Ecosystem Insights**  
   - Provides observations about the ecosystem based on detected species (e.g., predator presence, water body indicators).  

5. **Audio Visualization**  
   - Plots the waveform of the uploaded audio for visual inspection.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.8+  
- Streamlit  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- librosa  
- matplotlib  
- pydub  
- scipy  

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy librosa matplotlib pydub scipy
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd wildlife-sound-analyzer
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows

bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
Linux / Mac

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the App
Ensure your virtual environment is active.

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

Upload a wildlife audio file (WAV/MP3/FLAC).

View species classification, behavior analysis, ecosystem insights, and audio waveform.

Sample Input
Audio File: sparrow_chirping.wav

Uploaded audio containing bird chirping or frog croaking.

Expected Output
Audio Waveform:

Visual plot of the uploaded sound.

Species Classification:

csharp
Copy code
Detected Species: Sparrow with confidence: 87%
Behavior Analysis:

yaml
Copy code
Observed Behavior: Chirping, Nesting
Ecosystem Insights:

diff
Copy code
- Bird species active; indicates daytime activity
Notes
Currently uses a dummy random classifier for demonstration purposes.

For production, integrate a pre-trained audio classification ML model.

Can be extended to detect multiple species in one audio, generate spectrograms, and perform long-term monitoring.
